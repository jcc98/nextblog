## Thinking in the short-term and not in the long-term

The most notable mistake that I did (and a lot of people, probably) is getting into crypto and trying to secure gains as fast as possible. In the early stages, one must do a lot of research and understand what you're getting into. \
This mentality caused me to do stupid trades, jumping from coin to coin and blindly pursue money.

**Don't time the market. The one that wins is the one that's been longer in the market** would be the proper mentality when trading crypto.
 At first, I told myself that I would only be putting my money into high cap stable coins and let it accumulate overtime. \
 I first bought ADA and XRP when it was at around $1.4 and $0.7 respectively. It slowly started going higher and higher. I also put in some money on ETH and tried to trade an alt-coin with a very interesting and promising project in mind. (hint. 2D Games, NFTS & Betting) \
 Everything was going fine, my newly small created portfolio was gradually going up... Until I started getting into the danger zone... The zone where once you go in, it's really hard to go back; The BSC casino.
 I ended up putting money on a presale BSC coin that ended up rugging. Luckily, I managed to flee before I lost it all; I probably ended up losing 20% by this dumb decision. \
 That sadly wasn't the end of it. I started becoming more and more impatient. Checking my portfolio way too often, and getting way too emotional whenever it went up or down. A rookie mistake, really. \
 The right mentality to have is to consider the money you invested into crypto to be gone. In other words, you're digging your own grave if you grow too attached to it or when you are depending on a lot of gains such that you're able to pay your bills. (Picture stupid people putting their life investments without doing proper research into a dog coin because they read on the internet that it'd be a good idea)

 ## Getting too greedy, not doing enough research and thinking that you're too smart to get scammed.

 This pretty much goes together with thinking in the short-term and not in the long-term; getting too greedy could cause you to act on emotions and not make good objective trades. As for me, though, I was getting too greedy, thinking in the short-term which caused me to do a fatal move; fall for scams.
 The scam that screwed me over the most and took about 60% of my portfolio was an airdrop scam. Basically, you get sent tokens that allegedly are worth a big sum of money once you redeem them. I thought that I was smart and that I would never fall for scams. (hint: it's not about being smart, but rather being knowledgeable. Think about it this way: if you've been using the internet for a decade and know your way around it, it'd be incredibly hard to fall for phishing scams that you get sent weekly on your email. For someone that's completely new to the internet and doesn't know what it entails? Not so evident. This has nothing to do with intelligence, but rather experience. Or so I'd like to believe, perhaps.)
 Sadly though, I tried to redeem a token that was 100% a scam. The website looked relatively legit and normal; and they asked me to connect my Metamask wallet to be able to change my tokens into BNB. Hint hint: By giving authorization and access to your wallet, they can take all your tokens. Which is what happened to me. Well, kind of. They didn't take everything, just my ADA (which comprised ~60% or more of my portfolio.)
 What I'm assuming happened is, their site was coded to look for popular tokens (at the time, ADA was taking off and was going up by an insane amount, which means that it was an obvious target for scammers.) my smaller tokens didn't get traded away. \
 Completely shocked by what had happened to me, I panicked a little and looked if I could do anything about it, but of course I couldn't. Once you trade it, it's all gone.

 At this stage, I was left with around 250 dollars in my BSC network wallet. My ETH on the other hand was at around $150. Not much. Not to mention that 50% of that was in an alt coin, which would make me lose a good amount if I redeem it (ETH fees are quite high, sadly)

 At the end of the day, I ended up giving up. Told myself that I would put the remaining into a coin that seemed relatively promising then just quit crypto for the time being. Had I done that, though; I would have made over 7k dollars...

 ## Constantly checking the chart, getting too emotional and attached to your portfolio.

 Ironically enough, I started checking my portfolio more and more often despite telling myself that I would quit. The reason being, the coin that I had invested in wouldn't stop mooning; I essentially found a hidden gem. The coin that I had invested in at the time was at around 600k marketcap. (Hint: Its ATH is at 40m marketcap. Right now it's crabbing at around 20m.)
 The coin reached 3m marketcap. I ended up transferring the remainder of my ETH and put it all into the alt coin. After reaching 3m marketcap, though, it wouldn't budge. The developers were incredibly trustworthy and very professional. They were giving it their all and reassuring us with very promising updates and new features. I found this to be incredibly bullish and thought that the coin would go up. And it did; it went up from 3m to 4m, but then it quickly got dumped and went back to 3m, which caused me to lose hope and get incredibly impatient. This wouldn't have happened had I just stopped checking my portfolio, or at the very least had just checked it once or twice a week at most. Ultimately, I ended up cashing out and made up most of my losses. Doesn't sound too bad, right...? \
 After cashing out, the coin just mooned and mooned, going all the way up to 40m. (My $500 would have been around 6500 dollars at its peak) Of course it ended up going down; but even as of now it's still really high; at 20m, my $500 would be worth around 3500 dollars. Here's the thing, though. The altcoin has a relatively high fee, and most of it goes to passive BUSD reflections. In other words, If I cashed out right now, I wouldn't be getting 3500 dollars, but rather 3500 + all the BUSD reflections that I would have gotten. Which would have been a pretty hefty sum, considering that the amount you receive depends on the amount that you hold, and the current volume. (My stack was pretty respectable, and it kept mooning + a lot of crabbing activity going on. I'm not gonna bother doing the math, but I would have made a lot just by sitting on my ass and getting free BUSD reflections.)
 Who knows; maybe this coin will keep going up and even if it doesn't but still stays at around the current 20m marketcap, I would still be making passive income thanks to the BUSD reflections. 

 **Getting addicted to the BSC casino and doing reckless trades**

 After realizing that I had essentially lost over 6k in plausible gains, I felt devastated for a decent amount of time and ended up getting back into it, albeit with a way smaller bag of money. I told myself that I would only trade with around $200, which is what I ended up doing. 
Here comes the problem, though. After essentially finding such a nice hidden gem and almost made 50x+ the money that I invested, I started thinking that I knew what I was doing and started doing very stupid trades. Ultimately, I got honeypotted twice, rugged a few times and bought low and sold high on other occasions. In other words; I ended up losing 95% of my $200 stack. Pretty sad, really. But I had it coming and I deserve it. \
At the end of the day, though, I feel like to learn your lesson, one must go through pain. It's nice to have someone experienced tell you what you must and must not do in crypto trading, but it's easy to take it for granted and just do what you think is best. Hence why I don't regret screwing myself that much. For now, I'm going to stop trading, and just focus on studying and accumulating money by working. In the near future, though, I might casually get back into it, with all these learned lessons. 
Another tip: If you for whatever reason must cash out/you want to put your money into a different coin, for fuck's sake leave half your bag because there's always a chance that it might moon and you'll beat yourself over it if the coin ends up mooning in the near future.
